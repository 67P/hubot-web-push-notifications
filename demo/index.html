  <h2>Hubot Web Push Demo</h2>
  <p>
    You can use this demo client to subscribe to Web Push notifications with a
    Hubot chatbot running
    <a href="https://github.com/67P/hubot-web-push-notifications">hubot-web-push-notifications</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Change the Hubot URL to point to wherever your Hubot Express API is
    running. Then choose a username to get notifications for.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you have subscribed (you can see the subscription in your Hubot DEBUG
    logs), mention your name in a channel that Hubot is in. If your username is
    not present in that channel, and you don't have a tab focussed with this
    demo page (other tab is fine), you should receive a push notification with
    the message content.
